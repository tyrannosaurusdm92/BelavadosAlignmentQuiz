# Belavadös Blank Interactive Map Builder Templates

This pack contains four clean settlement map builder templates with all previous map, GeoJSON, named NPC, and named location data removed.

## Open first

Open `index.html`, then choose one of the four templates:

| Template | Location slots | Named NPC slots | World-travel NPC slots |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Capital City | 1,312 | 3,588 | 753 (21%) |
| City | 1,000 | 2,700 | 486 (18%) |
| Town | 220 | 600 | 54 (9%) |
| Village | 60 | 160 | 5 (3%) |

## What was intentionally removed

- No attached settlement map.
- No GeoJSON overlay records.
- No named NPC records.
- No named location records.
- No source settlement or province names.

The starter files only generate blank slot capacity at runtime. Names appear only after you import or generate them yourself.

## Import support

Each template accepts:

- `.svg` map generation output.
- `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif` map images.
- `.json` life simulator or location/NPC data.
- `.geojson` feature collections.
- `.html` / `.htm` files containing JSON script blocks or data attributes.

## Export support

Type the exact base filename in **Exact export file name**, then click **Export Named HTML**. The browser downloads that exact `.html` file with the current builder state embedded.

You can also export the builder state as JSON.


## Biome JSON merge

This revision merges the blank map builder templates with `Belavados_Biomes_JSON.zip`. Each settlement template contains hidden embedded biome-location JSON for its own settlement size. The JSON is stored in a hidden `<script id="belavados-biome-location-library" type="application/json">` block so the template remains standalone.

Open a template, cache 1–3 biome choices, then click **Populate Location Types**. The builder fills the allotted blank location slots with location type suggestions only. It does **not** generate named locations or named NPCs.

Blend behavior:

- 1 selected biome: 100% of location type slots from that biome profile.
- 2 selected biomes: 50% / 50%.
- 3 selected biomes: approximately 33.33% / 33.33% / 33.34%, with leftover slots assigned to the first cached choices so the exact location-slot total is preserved.

Example: choosing `Beach and grass with water`, `Hybrid tree and forest floor`, and `Hybrid farming forest grassland` gives each biome JSON roughly one third of the location type allotment for the selected settlement template.

A reference all-profile copy is also included at `data/biome_location_library.json`; the working templates do not need external JSON to run.
