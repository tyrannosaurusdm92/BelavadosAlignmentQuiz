# Onyx map asset catalogues — merged under `map_assets/`

This folder contains the merged Onyx map asset catalogue set.

## What changed

- All catalogue JSON files are now inside one `map_assets/` folder.
- A single all-assets merged catalogue was added:
  - `map_assets/map_assets_catalog_merged.catalog.json`
  - duplicate convenience alias: `map_assets/onyx_map_assets_merged.catalog.json`
- The per-source `.catalog.json` files are still included for backward compatibility.
- `map_assets_catalog.json`, `map_assets_catalog_manifest.json`, and `map_assets_catalog_index.json` were rebuilt to point at the merged catalogue and all per-source catalogues.

## Counts

- Source catalogues: 18
- Unique assets: 2798

## Image location

The JSON entries point to your local unzipped asset root:

`C:\Users\Public\Pictures\map_assets`

The images are not embedded in this ZIP.

## Install

Copy/drag this `map_assets/` folder into your `OnyxImagePackager` folder, replacing the older catalogue files when asked.
